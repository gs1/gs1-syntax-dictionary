XXXX-XX-XX

* The data titles for units of measure were aligned with GSCN 25-081.
* The linter function specification was changed to require a parameter defining the input length to process.
* The "key" linter was renamed to "gcppos1".
* The "keyoff1" linter was renamed to "gcppos2", and was added to AIs (8006) and (8026).
* The mandatory associations for AI (03) and AI (242) were amended in accordance with GSCN 24-020.
* Currency codes 191 (HRK), 694 (SLL) and 932 (ZWL) were removed and currency codes 179 (XAD) and 926 (VED) was added to correct alignment with ISO 4217.
* Significant performance improvement were made, including converting the cset39, cset64 and cset82 linters to use bit field lookups, converting the csumalpha and iban linters to use lookup tables of weights, minimisation of redundant scanning of inputs and the elimination of temporary buffers.

* To avoid potential conflation of months with minutes, the hhmm linter was renamed to hhmi, with the previous name being replaced with a stub.
* Linter exit points were converted to GS1_LINTER_RETURN{OK,ERROR} convenience macros.
* The binary search and bit field lookups were converted to utility macros.
* New AI (7041) for UFRGT UNIT TYPE, as approved with GSCN 23-272.
* New AI (716) for NHRN AIC, as approved with GSCN 24-157.
* New AIs (03) and (8014) for Master UDI-DI, as approved with GSCN 21-286.
* New ISO 4217 currency code 924 for ZWG.
* Replaced binary search with bitsets for ISO 3166-1 numeric, ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and ISO 4217 numeric lookups.
* The format specification for AIs (423) and (425) was changed to use multiple "[N3],iso3166" components, rather than a single "[N..15],iso3166list" component.
* The obsolete iso3166list linter was replaced with a deprecation stub to maintain API compatibility.
* AI (8020) is no longer permitted as a GS1 Digital Link URI data attribute.
* The AI (8008) component specification was simplified to "N6,yymmdd N2,hh [N2],mi [N2],ss", with new linters lint_{hh,mi,ss} created and old linters lint_{yymmddhh,mmoptss} replaced with deprecation stubs.
* A new keyoff1 linter replaces the key linter for AIs (00), (01), (02) and (03) in which in is the second data character of the respective compoment that represents the start of a GCP.


2024-06-10

* New AIs (7250) through (7259) for patient demographics, as approved with GSCN 22-246.
* New linters to support 8-digit dates, biological sex codes and position in sequence.
* New flag "?" indicating that an AI is a permitted GS1 Digital Link URI data attribute.


2023-12-11

* Minor update to linters for "csumalpha" and "iban" to validate data before calculating data length.
* New "+" syntax to enable mandatory associations of serialised GS1 identification keys when using AI (8030) DigSig i.e., enforces instance level compound keys such as AI (01) with (21) or instance level simple keys such as AI (253) with optional serial component made mandatory, when encoded with AI (8030).


2023-09-22

* New AIs (4330) maximum temperature in Fahrenheit, (4331) maximum temperature in Celsius, (4332) minimum temperature in Fahrenheit and (4333) minimum temperature in Celsius, as approved with GSCN 22-353.
* New "hyphen" linter to support new min/max temperature AIs.


2023-07-04

* New AI (8030) Digital Signatures (DigSig) and new "CSET 64" linter for the file-safe/URI-safe based 64 character set, as approved with GSCN 21-307.
* New "longitude" and "latitude" linters to replace "latlong" linter, to enable validation of each AI component separately.
* Corrected "key" linter with GCP minimum-length changed to 4.
* Corrected data titles, replacing "NO." with lowercase "No."


2023-03-22

* Added new AI (7241) for AIDC media type and AI (7242) for Version Control Number (VCN), as approved with GSCN 22-345.
* Corrected existing GRSN AI (8017) and (8018) with missing 'key' linter and invalid pairing.


2022-11-24
